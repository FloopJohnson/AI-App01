ALWAYS do this before making code changes:
1) Open and read docs/AGENTS_WIKI.md and docs/ERROR_INDEX.md and docs/PROJECT_MAP.md.
2) If any are missing or stale, run /wiki first.
3) When debugging, check ERROR_INDEX.md before proposing a fix.
4) When you proceed, briefly cite which wiki sections influenced the change.
